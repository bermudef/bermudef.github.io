title: My Coding Journey Begins!
---

Welcome to my development blog! I've just set up this GitHub Pages site to document my learning journey as a beginning developer.

## What I've Accomplished So Far

- ✅ Set up GitHub Pages with Jekyll Now theme
- ✅ Customized _config.yml with my personal information
- ✅ Created my first blog post (this one!)
- ✅ Started learning Python with Beautiful Soup tutorials

## What's Next

I'm planning to share my progress with:
- Python programming exercises and solutions
- Web scraping projects and experiments
- Coding challenges and how I solve them
- Mistakes I make and lessons learned

This blog will be my digital notebook as I grow from beginner to confident developer. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
